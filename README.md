# Trailly
Trailly was my thesis project.
This diploma thesis aims to develop an application capable of recording, uploading and
safe exploring hiking trails in Greece. It is important to note that the project’s primary
focus lies on enhancing the safety aspects of an explorer’s hiking experience while also
complementing already existing services responsible for updating them during their
hiking journeys. The application is designed as a platform for users to receive safety
updates, as well as, assistance in case of emergency during their hikes. It allows users to
receive and send reports and alerts regarding unexpected events that may occur during
their hike; such events may be fires, SOS signals, unexpected weather and trail issues. 
Additionally, the users will be able to access three-digit numbers of the agencies
responsible for acting on such events and receive guidance and help. Moreover, they will
be able to access safety tips and information provided from trustworthy guides on what
actions to take in those situations. Furthermore, the application facilitates the creation
of volunteer teams to assist fellow hikers in need when human intervention is possible. 
To conclude, crucial to note is that this application does not aim to replace existing
services but rather to complement and enhance them, providing yet another way for
people to reach out and enjoy hiking as safely as possible in the trails of Greece.
